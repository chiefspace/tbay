## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** to and from PostgreSQL database called snippets.
* [x] User can **obtain a catalog view of snippets in the database**.
* [x] User can **search for substring in messages** column.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Persist the snippets [into PostgresQL](http://google.com) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the blah blah items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://google.com)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for blah blah items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://google.com) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each blah blah item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
Dialog popup window to show what exactly was edited.  Find if no popup, then users may forget what was edited when returning to main screen/activity.

* [3] Refactoring code and seeing what overlaps may be
